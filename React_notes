Creating a new React App:

- Install create-react-app from the Facebook repository. It creates and setups a bunch of scripts needed to run React smoothly in browsers. 
If not installed yet, install npm install -g create-react-app 

- In the directory where you want to locate your React app. This will install React, react-dom and react-scripts (Babble, webpack, webpack dev server, etc)
On terminal create-react-app <nameofapp>

- Commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd photowall
  npm start


- Under <appname> in the src folder, dlete all files but index.js
- Inside index.js, delete all code. This will be our main entry file.
