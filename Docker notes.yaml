On terminal:

docker ps -a   -> Will list all docker containers in computer. 
docker run <image name>  -> it will run the image name and create a containder with a random name from that image
docker run --name <personal name of container> <image name>   -> Create new container with personal/custom name from image name
docker run -it --name <my-custom-name-container> <image name> bash  -> Go inside the container with bash after running docker container

docker images  -> this shows all docker images downloaded in computer 

docker rm $(docker ps -a -f status=exited -q) -> delete all exited containers

To build a custom docker image, Create a file called Dockerfile:

In Dockerfile:

FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get upgrade && apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3

Terminal:
docker build -t my-cutom-image-name .  -> this will create an image from that Dockerfile





mkdir DockerComposeFile -> create a new folder
cd DockerComposeFile

touch docker-compose.yml -> creates the docker compose YAML file 

vi docker-compose.yml -> This is to edit the yaml file
